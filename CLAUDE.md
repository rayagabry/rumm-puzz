# Rumikube Puzzle

Rummikub tile rearrangement puzzle PWA. Given a board of valid sets and one tile in hand, rearrange the board so all sets remain valid and the hand tile is placed.

## Stack

React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + vite-plugin-pwa. Tests via Vitest.

## Structure

- `src/domain/` — Tile/Set/Board types and validation (`tile.ts`, `set.ts`, `board.ts`)
- `src/solver/partition.ts` — Backtracking partition solver (can tiles be split into valid runs/groups?)
- `src/solver/difficulty.ts` — Min-moves scorer: counts distinct (source-set, dest-set) transfers under the max-stay matching. Also exports `computeOptimalSolution` which returns the witnessing solution partition + σ matching + move-pair set (used by the classifier).
- `src/generator/generate.ts` — Reverse-construction puzzle generator (guarantees solvability)
- `src/generator/classify.ts` — Technique classifier. Tags each puzzle's optimal solution by per-move source/dest kinds (`run`, `group`, `hand`, `new-run`, `new-group`) plus structural tags (`split`, `merge`, `dissolve`, `new-set`). Produces a canonical `signature` string used as a diversity bucket key.
- `src/puzzles/library.json` — 50 pre-generated puzzles (all hard difficulty: 5–8 moves)
- `src/state/usePuzzle.ts` — React game state hook. Played history lives in localStorage under `rumikube:played`, gated by `LIBRARY_VERSION` (`rumikube:libVersion`) — bump the constant when puzzle IDs are reused for new content so stale history clears on next load.
- `src/components/` — Tile, SetRow, Board, Hand, PuzzleScreen
- `src/screens/` — HomeScreen, WinScreen
- `scripts/generate-puzzles.ts` — Full library generation
- `scripts/regenerate-hard-balanced.ts` — Regenerates the library with `maxStartingSetSize=4`. Enumerates all valid starting partitions for each (solution, hand) source, classifies each, then greedy-picks the variant with the rarest technique signature so far. Yielded 40 distinct signatures across 50 puzzles, top-share 4%. Slow: pool build ~11min for 120 sources at MAX_VARIANTS=24.
- `scripts/classify-library.ts` — Diagnostic: prints the technique-signature histogram for the library (`npx tsx scripts/classify-library.ts`). Useful for spotting when the generator clusters puzzles into a few patterns.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — Dev server
- `npm run test` — 45 unit tests
- `npm run build` — Production PWA build
- `npm run gen-puzzles` — Regenerate `src/puzzles/library.json`. Run this after changing difficulty logic or ranges — library.json is derived data and its minMoves values go stale.

## Rules (no jokers)

- **Run:** 3+ same-color consecutive numbers
- **Group:** 3–4 same-number distinct-color tiles
- Tiles: 1–13 in red/blue/yellow/black, 2 copies each

## Difficulty

Measured by minimum *batched* moves — one move = one batch of tiles taken from a single source set (or the hand) and placed into a single destination set. Multiple tiles crossing the same (source, destination) pair count once. Library targets 5–8 moves.

Overlap uses tile type, not ID. setOverlap in difficulty.ts compares by (color, number), not t.id — the partition solver assigns duplicate copies arbitrarily, so ID-based comparison inflates move counts.

### Generation gotchas

- **Partition enumeration order matters.** `findAllPartitions` enumerates runs longest-first. The partition budget (maxPartitions) caps exploration, and the true min-moves partition is usually the one that keeps long runs intact — shortest-first would exhaust the budget on "split every run" subtrees and miss the trivial solution, producing puzzles rated hard but solvable in 1.
- **Generator post-verifies.** `generatePuzzle` runs `computeMinMoves` twice: a fast check (100 partitions / 500ms) to filter, then a slow confirm (2000 partitions / 5000ms) to catch hidden shorter solutions before shipping. Shipped `minMoves` comes from the verification pass.
- **Budgets are threaded through.** `findAllPartitions` (maxNodes), `findMaxStayMatching` (deadline), and `countMoves` (deadline) all bail on time/node limits. Without this the 8×8 matching blows up (~43M nodes).
- **Parallel-runs filter.** `hasParallelRuns` rejects boards with 3+ same-range runs across different colors (e.g. red/blue/black 11-12-13) — the regroup-by-number solution is too obvious.
- **Optional max set size.** `generatePuzzle` accepts `maxStartingSetSize` to cap tiles per set on the starting board (current hard library uses 4 — keeps boards visually compact on mobile). Filter is post-partition, so tighter caps lower yield.
- **Random partition pick for diversity.** `makeStartingBoard` enumerates up to 32 valid partitions via `findAllPartitions` and picks one at random, instead of always taking the first. Picking the first biases the library hard toward the same shape — a single signature ate ~34% of hard puzzles. Random selection roughly doubled distinct-signature count (15 → 23 across the hard library).
- **Balanced selection beats random pick.** `generatePuzzleVariants` returns every valid (starting-board, signature) pair for one source. `regenerate-hard-balanced.ts` builds a pool of sources, then greedy-picks rarest-signature variants for the final library — pushed distinct signatures 23 → 40 and top share 28% → 4% on the hard set. Slow-verify is deferred until *after* selection (verifying every variant during pool build is intractable). Some selected variants get rejected at slow-verify when a hidden shorter solution surfaces; keep the pool ≥4× target to absorb that.
- **Reverse-move construction was tried and abandoned.** Building the starting board by extracting a tile from the solution and applying typed "reverse moves" (split a run, dissolve a group, etc.) consistently produced 1-move-trivial puzzles: the solver finds a partition that just slots the hand into the gap left by extraction, ignoring the scrambles. Repartition-from-tile-pool is the right model — it also matches how Rummikub actually plays (rearrange existing valid sets to absorb a tile).
